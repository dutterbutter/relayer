## POLYGON MUMBAI TESTNET CONFIGURATION 
##
## Configured to support private transaction relaying, data proposing, 
## signature relaying, and data querying. 
## 
## Contracts supported:
## - Anchor 
## - VAnchor
## - SignatureBridge
##
## Configuration supports the following networks:
## - Rinkeby test network 
## - Goerli test network 
## - Optimism test network 
## - Arbitrum test network 
## - Harmony test network 
## 
## Collectively they make up a 6-sided bridge for fixed and variable deposits 
##
## NOTE: Ensure private keys are not exposed in this file!

## TODO: 
## - Update contract addresses for each testnet
## - Add private keys to .env file for each network 
## - Add GOVERNOR_PRIVATE_KEY to .env file 
## - Ensure each network is supported and has a deployed contracts
## - Better understand withdraw fee percentage, and gas limit fields 
## - Better understand `size` field in Anchor contract
## - Ask about `deployed-at` field 
## - Verify full config works
## - Add http-endpoint, ws-endpoint
